## Capitalization:

The server
 * Receives data from the client
 * Prints the original message
 * Capitalizes the message
 * Sends the capitalized version back to the client

The client
 * Takes input from the user (host address)
 * Takes input from the user (message)
 * Displays the return from the server (message capitalized)
